Thank you for downloading the GnuNeutron sourcecode.

The goal is a neutron playing program.

My idea is to reach this goal in the following steps:

1. Make a text based playing program which can play
   well and win most of the time.
2. Make a GUI for the program.
3. Improve the AI
4. Extend the program so it also can play Neutrino and a larger boardsize

Status: 
Only basic alphabeta search 

Command-line options:
Currently GnuNeutron supports these options:

--random the AI plays random moves
--pbem will make the program read a single line from standard input and uses
  that as moves then computes and display the best reply and exist.

All questions about this code just email me at: traxplayer@gmail.com and
you will normally get an answer within 48 hours.
